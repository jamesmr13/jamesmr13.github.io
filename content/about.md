I am in my 2nd year of a Master's program in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland - College Park currently working under Prof. Ramani Duraiswaimi as my research advisor and Prof. Behtash Babadi as my academic advisor.

I am an active duty Naval officer in the submarine community. I completed my first tour onboard USS WEST VIRGINIA (SSBN 736) (GOLD) where I served as the Main Propulsion Assistant and the Communications Officer. Currently, I am on shore duty attending my Master's program before returning to the fleet.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY where I graduated in 2017. I am originally from Longwood, FL a suburb of Orlando. I was married in 2017 to Rachel Robertson and we have two daughters, Peyton(3) and Dallas(1), and two dogs, Reese and Shiloh.
## Research Interests

* Underwater Acoustics
* Signal Processing
* Reinforcement Learning

I want to make life better for submariners like myself so I am working on projects in order to produce useful tools that can be utilized to better inform the submariners driving the boat or enhance the capabilities of AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles).
